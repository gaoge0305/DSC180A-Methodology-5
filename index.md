**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br>
The most interesting topic is how the transformer works in language models and how it encode and decode input sentence or words.<br>

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**<br>
I want to investigate how large language model fine-tuning performs and how much GPU resources we need.<br>

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**<br>
When training the model, we are currently using the deep learning approach. I might change to using trainers from Huggingface.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**<br>
I am interested in techniques that we could use to build and contribute to open-source applications.
